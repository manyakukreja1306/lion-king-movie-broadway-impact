This project analyzes how The Lion King movie releases impacted Broadway ticket prices using counterfactual time-series forecasting. The 2019 film caused an 18.6% price increase and reduced COVID-era decline by 14.47%. The study was extended to evaluate whether the December 20, 2024 release produced a similar effect.
